# this is an required and immutable section that must be copied between states. it defines main contract
# properties and permissions.
definition:

 issuer:
   # required. contract must have issuer (or issuers). on creation, the root contract must be signed by
   # all issuers.

   # issuer name, optional

 # consult current Universa state, maximum delayed contract creation time varies.
 created_at:
   now()
   # as yaml has no time type, this notion allow use different formats of time. unix time is number of second
   # from the unix epoch, in GMT zone (UTC+00:00):
#   __type: unixtime
#   seconds: 1501953889

 # required. must be in future.

 # required section, could be empty. Any immutable structured data issuer might need to include into the contract
 # this data will be also copied without change during any contract changes.

# required section. Data that represent current contract state, could be modified in accordance with
# 'permissions' section above

 # required. most often, we should specify contract owner. we could specify 'issuer' or provide a key
 owner:
   # we create contract to be owned by another person, so we must provide a key:
